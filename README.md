# Blog Goals

## Keeping on Track

> ### Listen, blogging can be extremely hard work.

> Write down what you want it to feel like when you have your blogging Mojo going strong.

1. 

> Pretend someone just asked you what your blog was about. Grab your notebook and write down your answer. Don't over think it. Try to write down exactly what you'd say to them in conversation. And don't worry if it sucks, we're about to make major improvements.

2. Vision goes here?

> Describe the 2-3 things you want to focus on with your blog.  Do they seem cohesive?  Are they fully encompassing what you want to do with your blog?

3. 

> Figure out who your Tyler is. Who is that one person who you want to try to impress with every post you write? Figure that out and your writing voice will improve. Â  When you can't figure out which word to use or what joke to tell or how to end your post, don't think "what would be the right way to do this?", instead think "What would Tyler like best?" and write it that way. As you do this you might push some readers away, but they aren't your ideal audience anyway. And in the process you'll attract a whole lot more Tylers who will resonate with what you're doing and spread the word.

4. 

> One of the key elements of defining your brand is figuring out the perspective you are writing from.
> > Figure out if there is a specific perspective you should be writing from. Is there a compelling angle or lens that you look at life through that makes your brand more interesting? Remember, perspective can be defined by what your job is, what you've been through, where you're at in life, or were you're going. This can be a tough one to wrestle with, but give it some thought and write down your conclusions before you move on.

5. 

> Based on how you described the 3 core elements of your blog, can you write a description of your blog that touches on at least 2 of those areas? Bonus points if you can use all 3.

## Up and Going Goals

1. About Me Page

2. Contact Page?  Using email, social media etc.

3. Set up Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter, Pintrest (?), Stumble Upon (?).

4. Tool that allows seemless posting to different social media websites from Camaleon backend.

5. Scheduling posting times.

6. Google statistics up and running.

7. Amazon Affiliate.

8. Possibly a way to send out positive affirmation emails/texts daily.

## Weekly Content Goals

1. Daily quote and writing a sentence or two on why it was picked.

2. One short blog post under 500 words.

3. One aggregate post where I share valuable things that I saw/expereinced over the last week.

4. Two longer posts that focus more on above content focuses.

5. Sprinkle in at least two little bits of personal information into the blog posts for the week.

6. Spend 10-15 minutes a day responding to comments.  It doesn't have to be anything crazy but make sure people know you read the comments section.  Along with this, filter out negative posts if need be.  Leave the original comment in a collapsable box and paraphrase what they were saying for other users.

## Monthly Exercises

1. Go back into Archive and see if I can write another post on a topic covered months ago.

2. Get out and about in nature and let the ideas for a blog flow.  (Take a notebook and puppy)

3. Brainstorm aggregation ideas for the next couple weeks.  Are they on focus or lacking with regards to positivity?

4. Brainstorm on a possible "Series" posting that could run for the next month.  If nothing comes, no big.  Try again next month.

5. Find solid stock photography that might work for the blog.
